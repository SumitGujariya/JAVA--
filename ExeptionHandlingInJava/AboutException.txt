First is Compile time error, Detected by the compiler. Prevents code from running.
Second is Run time error, we also those exception handling Occurs while the program is running. Often causes crashes.
Thirs is Logical error, Code runs but gives incorrect results. Hardest to find.

The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
The try and catch keywords come in pairs.

Syntax of writing the try catch method.
try {
  //  Block of code to try
}
catch(Exception e) {
  //  Block of code to handle errors
}


/*
This will generate an error, because myNumbers[10] does not exist.

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
    System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); // error!
  }
}

The output will be something like this.
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10
        at Main.main(Main.java:4)

*/

/*

Example
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    try {
      int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
      System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
    }
  }
}
*/

/*
Finally
The finally statement lets you execute code, after try...catch, regardless of the result:

Example
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
      System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
    } finally {
      System.out.println("The 'try catch' is finished.");
    }
  }
}
*/

/*
The throw keyword.
The throw statement allows you to create a custom error.
The throw statement is used together with an exception type. There are many exception types available in Java: ArithmeticException, FileNotFoundException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, SecurityException.

Example
Throw an exception if age is below 18 (print "Access denied"). If age is 18 or older, print "Access granted".

public class Main {
  static void checkAge(int age) {
    if (age < 18) {
      throw new ArithmeticException("Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.");
    }
    else {
      System.out.println("Access granted - You are old enough!");
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    checkAge(15); // Set age to 15 (which is below 18...)
  }
}
*/

/*
Errors and Exception Types
The table below shows some of the most common errors and exceptions in Java, with a short description of each:

Error/Exception	Description
ArithmeticError:- 	                Occurs when a numeric calculation goes wrong
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:-    Occurs when trying to access an index number that does not exist in an array
ClassNotFoundException:- 	          Occurs when trying to access a class that does not exist
FileNotFoundException:- 	          Occurs when a file cannot be accessed
InputMismatchException:- 	          Occurs when entering wrong input (e.g. text in a numerical input)
IOException:- 	                    Occurs when an input or output operation fails
NullPointerException:- 	            Occurs when trying to access an object referece that is null
NumberFormatException:- 	          Occurs when it is not possible to convert a specified string to a numeric type
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException:- 	Occurs when trying to access a character in a String that does not exist
*/

// Exception handling
/*
You can add more than one catch block, and Java will run the first one that matches the thrown exception type:

Example
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
      System.out.println(numbers[10]);  // ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
      int result = 10 / 0;              // ArithmeticException
    } 
    catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
      System.out.println("Array index does not exist.");
    } 
    catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero.");
    } 
    catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println("Something else went wrong.");
    }
  }
}
